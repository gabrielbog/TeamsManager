Why do I need to do this ?
</br>
Well, when a repository is cloned, it has a default remote called **origin** that points to your fork on GitHub, not the original repository it was forked from. To keep track of the original repository, you need to add another remote named. So, if you want to be able to keep track of the changes that are made by other members of the team you need to complete this step.

TeamsManager branches:

![branches](docs/branches.png)

Once the repo is cloned, you want to switch to **development** branch. For that, run the following command:

```bash
git checkout develop
```

Why do I need to do this ?
<br>
Because the **main branch** will be preserved only for changes that are tested and stable. Using a development branch is good practice because it kips the main branch clean, macking the end user experience better, by reducing the likelihood of bugs and unintended errors.

Now that you are on the development branch you can make you contribution.

---

After you finised your tasks, you want commit your changes:

```bash
git add *
git commit -m "feat: Your message"
```

After you commited your changes is time to push them to the remote repository:

```bash
git push -u origin develop
```

To pull the changes from the upstream repository run the following command:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/develop
```
